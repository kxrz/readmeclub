## Background

Xteink Community Hub is an unofficial, community-driven platform created to serve Xteink e-reader users worldwide. The project was founded in 2025 by Florent Bertiaux (LesWWW, known as u/iamkxrz on Reddit) to centralize and facilitate access to community-contributed resources, language files, documentation, and tools.

We help Xteink e-reader users discover, share, and access essential resources including language files, custom tools, documentation, and community knowledge. The platform solves the problem of scattered resources by providing a centralized hub where users can browse curated content, submit their own contributions, and access over 160 community-curated tips and tricks.

What makes Xteink Community Hub unique is its emphasis on community safety, transparency (with prominent disclaimers about unofficial nature), and comprehensive resources including a global user map showing the worldwide Xteink community distribution across 120+ countries.
