<h2>TL;DR – 10 Essential Things Before You Begin</h2>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Purchase ONLY through the official https://www.xteink.com/ website.</strong> Do not purchase from AliExpress or other third-party marketplaces. There is no official Xteink presence on AliExpress; devices purchased there are unsupported and may not be authentic.</li>
	<li><strong>Update firmware immediately after receiving your device</strong> (Sync → System Update). Regular updates fix bugs, improve performance, and add features. Check support@xteink.com or r/xteinkereader for the latest information.</li>
	<li><strong>The community hub at https://xteink.dontthinkjustbuild.com/ is your reference for tools, resources, and community guides.</strong> This is maintained by volunteers and aggregates user-created resources, custom fonts, batch converters, wallpapers, and more.</li>
	<li><strong>EPUB files work best with Calibre optimization.</strong> Use the <strong>EPUB Workflow Plugin for Calibre</strong> at https://xteink-community-hub.replit.app/ddl?record=recdl1eCLELhoWfr4 to batch-process EPUBs with one click. Check https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/ for the latest optimization guides.</li>
	<li><strong>Image and font support are limited.</strong> Images must be ≤1024×1024 pixels and &lt;2 MB. Custom fonts need special .bin format conversion. Use the <strong>Web Font Maker</strong> at https://xteink.lakafior.com to convert TTF fonts to .bin format online, or the <strong>ePaper Font Converter</strong> (iOS app) at https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dotink/id6754073002.</li>
	<li><strong>File transfer works via WiFi hotspot or microSD card.</strong> The hotspot method is most user-friendly. Always format your microSD to <strong>exFAT</strong> (not FAT32) to avoid file size issues.</li>
	<li><strong>There is no built-in frontlight.</strong> The device is not readable in complete darkness. Use the official magnetic reading light or any standard book light if you need to read in low light.</li>
	<li><strong>Battery life is measured in weeks, not days.</strong> E Ink technology is extremely efficient; WiFi and Bluetooth drain the most power. Most users report 2-4 weeks between charges with regular reading.</li>
	<li><strong>Warranty and support terms must be verified live</strong> on https://www.xteink.com/pages/contact or by emailing support@xteink.com at the time you need support. Terms can change and community information is not binding.</li>

<h2>1. Setup and Configuration</h2>

<h3>Where to Purchase and Getting Started</h3>

<p><strong>The only recommended source for purchasing the Xteink X4 is the official website: https://www.xteink.com/</strong></p>

<p>This ensures you receive an authentic device with full manufacturer support, warranty coverage, and access to official customer service. Devices purchased from the official site include genuine hardware, pre-loaded firmware, and access to technical support through support@xteink.com.</p>

<p><strong>AliExpress and third-party marketplaces are not official sales channels.</strong> There is no official Xteink store on AliExpress or other platforms. Community members strongly advise against purchasing from these sources because:</p>

<ul>
	<li>No guarantee of authenticity or genuine warranty support</li>
	<li>Unclear device history and firmware version</li>
	<li>Support requests may be redirected or ignored</li>
	<li>Returns and refunds are handled through marketplace policies, not the manufacturer</li>
	<li>Device firmware may be outdated</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have already purchased from a third-party source, contact support@xteink.com to clarify your warranty status.</p>

<h3>Unboxing and First Steps</h3>

<p>Upon receiving your Xteink X4 from the official website, you will find:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The X4 e-reader device itself</li>
	<li>One 32GB microSD card (pre-installed in the device)</li>
	<li>USB-C charging cable and power adapter</li>
	<li>USB-A microSD card reader (for direct file transfer via computer)</li>
	<li>2 MagSafe ring stickers (for phones without built-in MagSafe)</li>
	<li>2 quality screen protectors</li>
	<li>Quick Start Guide (in the device&#39;s language of origin)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Verify all items are present and undamaged immediately upon receipt.</strong> Check that the microSD card is properly seated (push gently until it clicks into place) and that the device powers on when the Power button is held for 2-3 seconds.</p>

<h3>Firmware Update – Critical First Step</h3>

<p><strong>The absolute first action after powering on your device should be to update the firmware.</strong> Even if the device shipped with current firmware, checking for updates ensures you have the latest bug fixes, performance improvements, and feature additions. Firmware updates are delivered over-the-air (OTA) and are cumulative.</p>

<p>To update firmware:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Press the Power button to turn on the device</li>
	<li>Connect to WiFi (Settings → WiFi) or use the built-in hotspot (192.168.3.3, password: 12345678)</li>
	<li>Navigate to Sync → System Update</li>
	<li>The device will check for available updates</li>
	<li>If an update is available, confirm and allow the installation to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)</li>
	<li>The device will restart automatically</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>After the firmware update completes</strong>, open any book file, press the OK button to access the menu, select &quot;Index,&quot; and choose &quot;Rebuild Index.&quot; This reindexing process ensures the device properly catalogs all your files and reading history.</p>

<p>Firmware updates typically arrive regularly with bug fixes and improvements. For the latest information, check https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/ or contact support@xteink.com.</p>

<h3>Initial Hardware Setup</h3>

<p>The Xteink X4 is exceptionally simple to set up physically. If your phone lacks built-in MagSafe support (phones before iPhone 12), apply the 2 MagSafe ring stickers to your phone or case. The X4 itself has integrated magnets on the back that align with the MagSafe standard, enabling immediate attachment to compatible phones, cases, and accessories.</p>

<p>Apply one or both of the included screen protectors to the front of the X4 if desired. Many users apply one immediately to protect against scratches during initial use, and save the second as a backup.</p>

<p>Charge the device for at least 30 minutes using the included USB-C cable before first use. You&#39;ll see a battery indicator on screen while charging. The device is ready to use once the charging graphic indicates a full battery.</p>

<h2>2. Device Overview and Hardware</h2>

<h3>Physical Dimensions and Portability</h3>

<p>The Xteink X4 is engineered for extreme portability, making it one of the lightest and most compact dedicated e-readers available. The device weighs just <strong>74 grams</strong>—lighter than a deck of playing cards (94g), significantly lighter than any smartphone (modern phones weigh 150-250g), and only marginally heavier than two AA batteries combined (90g).</p>

<p>The physical dimensions are equally compact: <strong>114mm × 69mm × 5.9mm</strong> (approximately <strong>4.49 × 2.72 × 0.23 inches</strong>). These measurements mean the X4 is smaller than a standard credit card in both length and width, though slightly thicker. This combination of weight and size makes the device genuinely pocket-friendly—it fits comfortably in shirt breast pockets, jeans front pockets, jacket interior pockets, small messenger bags, or even large wallet compartments. Many users report carrying the X4 without noticing it&#39;s there.</p>

<p>The compact size enables reading scenarios impossible with larger e-readers: reading while standing on crowded public transit, reading while eating lunch at your desk, tucking it into a lanyard around your neck, or clipping it to a belt or bag strap. For travelers, the X4 replaces dozens of physical books (a typical EPUB is 1-3MB, so you fit 700-1000 books on the included 32GB microSD) while weighing less than a single paperback. Ultralight backpackers, digital nomads, and anyone prioritizing minimalism finds the X4 transformative.</p>

<h3>Display and Screen Technology</h3>

<p>The Xteink X4 features a <strong>4.3-inch electronic ink (E Ink) display</strong> with a resolution of <strong>480 × 800 pixels</strong>, delivering <strong>220 pixels per inch (PPI)</strong>. This pixel density is sufficiently high to render text without visible pixelation at normal reading distances, creating sharp, crisp typography comparable to printed books.</p>

<p>The display technology is Electronic Paper (E Ink), which differs fundamentally from LCD and OLED screens used in phones and tablets. E Ink displays only consume power when changing the image (when you turn a page). Maintaining a static display uses essentially zero power—this is why battery life is measured in weeks rather than hours. The technology produces exceptional contrast and readability even in bright sunlight (unlike LCD/OLED which become washed out), while generating zero blue light (no sleep disruption from nighttime reading).</p>

<p><strong>Screen size implications:</strong> At 4.3 inches, the screen is notably smaller than typical e-readers (most range from 6-8 inches). This results in displaying approximately 5-6 words per line and 13-15 lines of text simultaneously, depending on font size and margin settings. New users often express initial concern about this, but adaptation happens quickly—most users report comfortable reading after just one or two hours, and the forced focus of a smaller screen can actually reduce eye strain and improve concentration compared to larger displays. The frequent page turns create natural reading rhythm and break points.</p>

<p>The display is laminated (minimal air gap between the E Ink panel and protective glass), resulting in excellent contrast and a genuinely paper-like visual experience. The screen is flush with the device body (not recessed), contributing to the sleek aesthetic.</p>

<p>The X4 is available in two color options: <strong>black</strong> and <strong>white</strong>. The colors refer to the device body/bezel, not the screen itself (all E Ink displays appear as black text on white/gray background regardless). Both perform identically; the choice is entirely aesthetic.</p>

<h3>Processor, OS, and System Architecture</h3>

<p>The Xteink X4 runs a <strong>custom-designed, lightweight operating system</strong> specifically optimized for reading. It is <strong>not Android</strong>, nor is it based on any other general-purpose mobile OS. This purpose-built approach means the device is exceptionally fast at its intended function (opening books, navigating chapters, rendering text) while maintaining week-long battery life because there&#39;s no OS overhead from apps, notifications, background services, or UI animations.</p>

<p>The device uses an <strong>ESP32-based architecture</strong>—a microcontroller platform known for WiFi/Bluetooth capabilities, low power consumption, and sufficient processing power for e-reader tasks.</p>

<p>The custom OS means the X4 is fundamentally focused: there are no distractions, notifications, background apps, or task switching. You turn it on to read; you turn it off when done. This simplicity is a feature, not a limitation—it creates what many users describe as the most distraction-free reading experience available.</p>

<h3>Connectivity: WiFi and Bluetooth</h3>

<p>The Xteink X4 includes <strong>WiFi connectivity supporting 802.11n (WiFi 4) on the 2.4 GHz frequency band only</strong>. It does <strong>not support 5 GHz networks</strong> or newer WiFi 6 standards. This is important to know when troubleshooting WiFi issues.</p>

<p>WiFi on the X4 serves purposes including firmware updates and file transfer via hotspot.</p>

<p>The device also includes <strong>Bluetooth support</strong> primarily for connecting <strong>wireless page-turner accessories</strong>—small handheld devices with buttons that allow hands-free page navigation. Bluetooth connections persist between sessions once paired, so devices automatically reconnect when within range.</p>

<h3>Storage: MicroSD Card and Capacity</h3>

<p>The Xteink X4 uses a <strong>microSD card for all file storage</strong>. The device comes with a <strong>32GB microSD card pre-installed</strong>, which is sufficient for most readers—capacity depends on file format and size, but typically accommodates <strong>700-1000 ebooks</strong> (average EPUB: 1-3MB; average TXT: smaller; illustrated books can be 10-50MB).</p>

<p><strong>Critical requirement: always format to exFAT</strong>, not FAT32. This is because:</p>

<ul>
	<li>FAT32 has a 4GB maximum file size per file, problematic for large TXT or EPUB files</li>
	<li>exFAT supports files of any size, is fully compatible with Windows/Mac/Linux, and maintains Unicode support for international filenames</li>
	<li>The X4 firmware fully supports exFAT with no compatibility issues</li>
</ul>

<p>The microSD card is inserted into the <strong>microSD slot on the left side of the device</strong> (when holding it normally). Insert gently until you hear a click—this indicates proper seating. To remove, push slightly until you hear another click and the card pops out.</p>

<h3>Buttons and Physical Controls</h3>

<p>The Xteink X4 employs an entirely <strong>button-based control interface</strong> with no touchscreen. This design choice has significant implications:</p>

<p><strong>Front buttons (4 total, arranged in two pairs):</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Left pair:</strong> Back button (left side), OK/Confirm button (right side)</li>
	<li><strong>Right pair:</strong> Up button (upper position), Down button (lower position)</li>
</ul>

<p>These buttons function differently depending on context. In menus, Up/Down navigate options and OK confirms selections. During reading, Up/Down can turn pages or perform other assigned functions. Back always exits menus and returns to books.</p>

<p><strong>Side buttons (2 total, on right edge):</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Upper button:</strong> Default = Previous Page</li>
	<li><strong>Lower button:</strong> Default = Next Page</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Additional buttons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Power button</strong> (top right corner) — short press wakes from sleep, long press powers on/off completely</li>
	<li><strong>Reset button</strong> (recessed, left side near microSD slot) — used only for force-restart if device becomes unresponsive</li>
</ul>

<p>The button-only interface takes perhaps 5-15 minutes to adapt to for users coming from touchscreen devices, but becomes intuitive quickly. Advantages include: no accidental touches while reading, more precise navigation control, the ability to read without touching the screen (avoiding fingerprints), functionality even with gloves, and clear tactile feedback.</p>

<h3>Battery and Power</h3>

<p>The Xteink X4 houses a <strong>650 mAh battery</strong>. E Ink technology is so efficient that this modest battery delivers exceptional battery life—weeks of use on a single charge under normal reading conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Real-world battery life reports from the community:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Light readers</strong> (30-60 minutes daily): 4-6 weeks between charges</li>
	<li><strong>Moderate readers</strong> (1-3 hours daily): 2-3 weeks between charges</li>
	<li><strong>Heavy readers</strong> (4-5+ hours daily): 1-2 weeks between charges</li>
	<li><strong>Minimal use:</strong> Users report going a month without charging</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Power consumption factors:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Page turns</strong> consume a small amount of power (the largest discretionary consumer)</li>
	<li><strong>WiFi connectivity</strong> uses significant power when active; disable when not transferring files</li>
	<li><strong>Bluetooth</strong> moderate drain when actively connected</li>
	<li><strong>Processor activity</strong> minimal since there&#39;s no background OS activity</li>
	<li><strong>Display maintenance</strong> nearly zero power—E Ink doesn&#39;t drain power maintaining a static image</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Initial Configuration and First Use</h2>

<h3>Language and Interface Settings</h3>

<p>When you first power on the Xteink X4, you&#39;ll be prompted to select your preferred language. The device supports:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>English</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Simplified Chinese (简体中文)</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Japanese (日本語)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Your language selection applies to the entire interface and persists even after firmware updates.</p>

<h3>WiFi Configuration</h3>

<p>The Xteink X4 can operate in two WiFi modes: <strong>connecting to an existing network</strong> or <strong>creating its own hotspot</strong>.</p>

<h4><strong>Connecting to Existing WiFi</strong></h4>

<p>Navigate to Settings → WiFi Connection and select your network from the list. If your network doesn&#39;t appear, ensure it&#39;s broadcasting on the 2.4 GHz frequency band (not 5 GHz only). Use the on-screen keyboard to enter your password:</p>

<ul>
	<li>OK button: Select letters</li>
	<li>Up/Down buttons: Navigate the character grid</li>
	<li>Back button: Delete/backspace</li>
</ul>

<p>The device remembers this network for future automatic connections.</p>

<h4><strong>Hotspot Mode</strong></h4>

<p>The X4 can create its own WiFi network for file transfer without requiring external WiFi infrastructure. To enable:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Navigate to Sync → WiFi Hotspot</li>
	<li>The device broadcasts a network named &quot;E-Paper&quot; (or similar)</li>
	<li>Default password: <strong>12345678</strong></li>
	<li>Connect from any computer or phone to this network, then open a web browser to <strong>192.168.3.3</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The hotspot provides a simple file upload interface accessible through any web browser.</p>

<h3>MicroSD Card and Storage Setup</h3>

<p><strong>Format the microSD card to exFAT before first use</strong> if you plan to upgrade from the included card. To format on Windows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Insert the card using a card reader</li>
	<li>Open File Explorer, right-click the drive</li>
	<li>Select &quot;Format&quot;</li>
	<li>Choose &quot;exFAT&quot; from the file system dropdown</li>
	<li>Click &quot;Start&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>On Mac, use Disk Utility; on Linux, use GParted or command-line tools. Once formatted, insert the card into the device until it clicks into place.</p>

<h3>Button Customization and Control Settings</h3>

<p>Navigate to Settings → Customize Main Button to reassign the four front buttons to different functions. Settings → Swap Side Button reverses the page-turn buttons—useful for left-handed users or if you prefer navigation reversed.</p>

<p>Settings → Hold Power adjusts how long to press Power for on/off (prevents accidental shutdowns if you rest your hand on the device).</p>

<h3>Sleep and Auto-Off Timers</h3>

<p>Configure power management through Settings:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Sleep Time:</strong> How long without button presses before the screen turns off (recommended: 5-10 minutes)</li>
	<li><strong>Power-Off Timer:</strong> Complete shutdown time (recommended: 20-30 minutes)</li>
</ul>

<p>These settings optimize battery life while preventing unnecessary shutdowns during reading pauses.</p>

<h3>Firmware Update and Index Rebuild</h3>

<p>After initial setup and any firmware update, navigate to any book file, press OK to open the menu, select &quot;Index,&quot; and choose &quot;Rebuild Index.&quot; This typically takes 30-60 seconds and should be performed after each major firmware update.</p>

<h2>4. File Management and Organization</h2>

<h3>Creating a Logical Folder Structure</h3>

<p>The Xteink X4 scans for compatible files in the root directory of the microSD card and in any subfolders you create. Creating a logical folder structure dramatically improves navigation and experience, especially as your library grows.</p>

<p><strong>Organization approaches:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>By Genre:</strong> Fiction, Non-Fiction, Science Fiction, Mystery, Romance, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>By Author:</strong> Creates a folder for each author with all their works inside</li>
	<li><strong>By Status:</strong> To-Read, Currently-Reading, Completed</li>
	<li><strong>By Language:</strong> English, French, Spanish, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Hybrid approach:</strong> Fiction → Science Fiction → Asimov, for example</li>
</ul>

<p>Files and folders display alphabetically in the Folder menu. Consider prefixing folder names with numbers for custom ordering: 01-To-Read, 02-Currently-Reading, 03-Completed.</p>

<h3>Supported File Types and Formats</h3>

<p><strong>Books:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>EPUB</strong> — recommended format, maintains formatting, table of contents, chapter navigation</li>
	<li><strong>TXT</strong> — supported, plain unformatted text, excellent for simple content</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Images:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>JPG</strong> — supported for wallpapers and in-EPUB illustrations</li>
	<li><strong>BMP</strong> — supported for wallpapers and in-EPUB illustrations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fonts:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Custom fonts (.bin)</strong> — proprietary format for custom typography</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Not supported:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>PDF</strong> — not natively readable; use Calibre to convert to EPUB first</li>
	<li><strong>Markdown (.md)</strong> — convert to TXT or EPUB using Calibre or the <strong>Markdown to ePub</strong> converter at https://xteink-community-hub.replit.app/ddl?record=recno5uXi4QvR1uZ3</li>
	<li><strong>Other formats</strong> (MOBI, AZW, DOCX, etc.) — convert using Calibre</li>
</ul>

<h3>MicroSD Card Formatting and Optimization</h3>

<p>Always format microSD cards to <strong>exFAT</strong> using your computer before inserting into the X4. The device works with the included 32GB card but will also accept larger cards (verify with the community on r/xteinkereader for current recommendations).</p>

<p><strong>File system details:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>exFAT: No maximum file size per file, supports Unicode filenames, fully compatible with Windows/Mac/Linux</li>
	<li>FAT32: Maximum 4GB per file (problematic for large TXT files)</li>
	<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Always use exFAT for new cards</li>
</ul>

<h3>File Organization Best Practices</h3>

<p>Place book files either in the root directory or in organized subfolders. The device displays up to 100-200 files per folder comfortably; more can cause slight menu lag. For very large libraries:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create 10-20 top-level folders</li>
	<li>Distribute books across folders to keep folder sizes manageable</li>
	<li>Use meaningful folder names for quick navigation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Backup and Library Management</h3>

<p>Maintain backup copies of your ebook library on your computer or cloud storage. This protects against:</p>

<ul>
	<li>MicroSD card failure or corruption</li>
	<li>Accidental file deletion</li>
	<li>Device loss or damage</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. EPUB Optimization and File Preparation</h2>

<h3>Why EPUB Optimization Matters</h3>

<p>EPUBs vary tremendously in quality, formatting, and structure. Some are carefully crafted by professional publishers; others are hastily scanned and OCR&#39;d. Files from different sources may have malformed HTML, inconsistent formatting, broken table of contents, embedded fonts that conflict with the X4&#39;s rendering, unused CSS styling that bloats file size, or typographical inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Optimizing EPUBs before transferring them to the X4 prevents most common display and navigation issues.</p>

<h3>Calibre: Essential Tool</h3>

<p><strong>Calibre</strong> is a free, open-source ebook management application available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Download from https://calibre-ebook.com/</p>

<h3>EPUB Optimization Tools</h3>

<p>The community has created several tools to streamline EPUB optimization:</p>

<p><strong>1. EPUB Workflow Plugin for Calibre</strong> (One-click optimization)</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>URL:</strong> https://xteink-community-hub.replit.app/ddl?record=recdl1eCLELhoWfr4</li>

<p><strong>3. Markdown to ePub Converter</strong> (For converting Markdown files)</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>URL:</strong> https://xteink-community-hub.replit.app/ddl?record=recno5uXi4QvR1uZ3</li>
	<li><strong>GitHub:</strong> https://github.com/kxrz/md_to_epub</li>
	<li><strong>Features:</strong> Converts Markdown files to beautifully formatted ePub books with interactive terminal interface</li>
	<li><strong>Best for:</strong> Writers and note-takers wanting to convert Markdown documents to readable ebooks</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common EPUB Optimization Steps</h3>

<p>If using Calibre manually, common optimization steps include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Repair HTML</strong> — fixes broken or malformed HTML tags and structural issues</li>
	<li><strong>Beautify All Files</strong> — reformats internal HTML and CSS for consistency</li>
	<li><strong>Delete Unused CSS</strong> — removes CSS rules that aren&#39;t applied to content, reducing file size</li>
	<li><strong>Smarten Punctuation</strong> — converts straight quotes to curly quotes and fixes em-dashes</li>
	<li><strong>Check File</strong> — validates no remaining errors or warnings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Issues and Solutions</h3>

<p><strong>Word spacing problems in English:</strong> Ensure you&#39;re running the latest firmware. If you&#39;re already on current firmware, try re-optimizing the EPUB and pay special attention to punctuation normalization.</p>

<p><strong>Books starting at wrong chapter:</strong> Use Calibre to Repair HTML, which usually fixes internal navigation structure.</p>

<p><strong>Missing or incorrect images:</strong> Images must be ≤1024×1024 pixels and &lt;2 MB. Use Calibre to view and resize images if needed.</p>

<p><strong>Font-related issues:</strong> The X4 uses its own fonts; embedded fonts in EPUBs can cause conflicts. Use Calibre to strip embedded fonts, allowing the X4&#39;s native fonts to render all text.</p>

<p><strong>Characters appearing as boxes/question marks:</strong> The font is missing glyphs for those characters. Switch to a custom font that includes the necessary character set.</p>

<h3>Batch Processing Libraries</h3>

<p>For large existing libraries, process files in batches using Calibre or the community tools:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Use the <strong>EPUB Workflow Plugin</strong> or <strong>EPUB Batch Workflow</strong> script</li>
	<li>Select all your EPUB files</li>
	<li>Run the automated optimization</li>
	<li>Transfer the optimized batch to the X4</li>
</ol>

<h2>7. Fonts and Languages</h2>

<h3>Built-in Fonts</h3>

<p>The Xteink X4 ships with <strong>two default fonts</strong> pre-installed and optimized for E Ink display:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A serif font (similar to Times New Roman)</li>
	<li>A sans-serif font (similar to Arial)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both fonts are available in multiple sizes and include complete glyphs for English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Japanese.</p>

<h2>Closing Words</h2>

<p>The Xteink X4 represents a specific vision of e-reading: minimal, portable, focused, and accessible. This guide aims to serve as a comprehensive reference for every aspect of ownership—from initial setup to advanced customization.</p>

<p>The device&#39;s greatest strengths (extreme portability, distraction-free reading, affordable pricing, exceptional battery life) make it exceptional for specific use cases, even as its limitations (no frontlight, small screen, limited format support) prevent it from being a universal solution.</p>

<p>The active development from Xteink (regular firmware updates), engaged community (sharing resources, troubleshooting, collaborating), and growing ecosystem suggest the X4 is not just a product but the beginning of a meaningful community.</p>
