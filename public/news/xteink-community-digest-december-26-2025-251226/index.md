## 🎄 Quick Xteink X4 Review (December 25)

A new user review titled **[“quick xteink x4 review”](https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1pvqpey/quick_xteink_x4_review/)** was posted on Christmas Day.  

**Highlights:**  
- Battery still full after days of use.  
- Screen praised for sharpness and paper‑like feel.  
- Extremely pocketable, ideal for quick sessions.  

**Criticism:**  
- No frontlight, still the biggest missing feature.  
- Some quirks remain in the stock software.  

Eighteen upvotes on a quiet day show that the X4 continues to generate positive attention even during the holidays.  

## 🛫 Shipping Delays and Order Status

Several threads this week reported **AliExpress or Cat3c store orders** stuck on “Confirmed.”  
Users who ordered in early December say their tracking has yet to update.  

Community members recommend:  
- Emailing **support@xteink.com** directly instead of using store chat.  
- Expecting slower responses during the Christmas and Lunar New Year period.  

Discussion also resurfaced around **X3 pre‑order emails** and the confusion between “founding member” discount codes and public pre‑order pages.  


## 📻 Xteink X4 Mentioned on Games at Work Podcast

The X4 unexpectedly appeared on the **[Games at Work dot Biz](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/games-at-work-dot-biz/id530932838)** episode from **December 21**.  

The hosts compared the device to retro gaming consoles and classic minimalist hardware like the **ZX Spectrum** and **Virtual Boy**, describing it as a “pure single‑purpose tool done right.”  
This marks one of the first times the X4 crosses over from e‑reader discussion into broader tech and gaming circles.  


## 💬 Discussion Highlights from the December 18 Digest

The **[community digest post on December 18](https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1ppvud0/xteink_community_digest_december_18_2025/)** gathered over forty upvotes and several community follow‑ups.  

- A wallpaper pagination bug on ReadMe.club was spotted and fixed the same day.  
- Users requested an **email newsletter version** of the digest.  
- More direct Reddit link references were added for future editions.  
- Several readers shared their **X3 pre‑order issues**, helping each other while waiting for official replies.  

One comment summed it up well:  
> It would be nice to subscribe to this as an email newsletter!


## 💬 Other Active Threads This Week

The following threads remain active, even with the slower pace of the holidays:  

- **[A guide to the EPUB to XTC converter](https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1poik5o/a_guide_to_the_epub_to_xtc_converter/)** – users refining batch settings and image optimization.  
- **[Has someone received the X3 email?](https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1pj7io7/has_someone_received_the_x3_email/)** – still active pre‑order questions.  
- **[Buy or wait?](https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1pp9ukd/buy_or_wait/)** – X4 vs X3 early‑bird decisions.  


## 🎁 Gift Week Experiences

Multiple users shared receiving an X4 as a holiday gift.  

A post from December 22 titled **“I did a lot of reading on this forum and some preparation before purchasing”** described an AliExpress order placed for **$45** on December 1, received by December 11, and immediately ready for use.  

> I love this device! When the x4 arrived… I switched to English and have successfully read at least two epubs so far.

The sentiment across several similar threads is consistent: delivery can take a few weeks, but satisfaction on arrival remains high.

- Community requested a newsletter format for digests.  
- More direct Reddit references were added to the hub.  

**[ReadMe.club](https://www.readme.club)** remains the core resource center for guides, EPUB tools, firmware utilities, and translations.  

## 📅 What’s Next
