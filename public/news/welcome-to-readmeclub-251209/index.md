> Welcome to Readme.club - The New Community Hub

I'm thrilled to announce the launch of the completely redesigned community platform! After some development, I'm proud to introduce **Readme.club** - your new home for everything Xteink.

## What's New?

### Complete Rebranding
I've rebranded from the previous platform (*xteink.dontthinkjustbuild.com*) to **Readme.club**, reflecting its mission to be the central hub for the Xteink community. The new name represents the goal of being the "read me" guide for all Xteink users.

### Enhanced Features

- Browse and download tools, utilities, and resources created by the community
- Submit your own resources to help fellow users
- Star your favorite resources for easy access

**Wallpaper Gallery**
- Discover beautiful wallpapers optimized for your Xteink device

## Multi-Language Support

Readme.club is now available in **5 languages**:

- Español (Spanish)

All interface elements are translated, making the platform accessible to users worldwide. Resource descriptions remain in their original submission language to preserve authenticity.

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning! I have exciting plans for the future:

- More community features
