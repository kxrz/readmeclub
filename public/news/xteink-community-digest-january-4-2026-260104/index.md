## ☀️ Direct Sunlight Performance Questions Emerge

A new thread posted on **January 3** titled **["XTEX4 direct sunlight issue — recent batch or normal"](https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1q33otu/xtex4_direct_sunlight_issue_recent_batch_or_normal_/)** sparked discussion about the X4's behavior in strong outdoor light.

The user reported that text becomes difficult to read after 5–10 seconds when exposed to intense direct sunlight, even though the screen looks perfectly sharp indoors or in the shade.

This prompted community members to share their own outdoor experiences with the device. The conversation centers on whether this is a **specific production batch issue** or a general **limitation of the e-ink panel technology** used in the X4.

For users planning outdoor reading sessions—particularly during summer—this thread is worth following for clarification from Xteink or community testing data.

## ⭐ The "9/10 Device" Review Resonates

The **["quick xteink x4 review"](https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1pvqpey/quick_xteink_x4_review/)** posted on December 25 continued gaining traction throughout this week.

The reviewer calls the X4 their **"favorite tech purchase of the last five years"** and rates it 9/10, highlighting:

- One-handed form factor and pocketability
- Distraction-free reading experience
- Simple, focused OS design
- Excellent battery life
- Clean industrial aesthetic

The single deduction is the missing **frontlight**, which remains the universal ask from the community.

This review encapsulates the core sentiment: **the hardware concept is exceptional**, and most limitations are software-related or aspirational features rather than fundamental design flaws.

## 🔧 CrossPoint Firmware Hits Critical Momentum

**January 4, 2026** saw a major milestone: **["CrossPoint - A month's retrospective from the developer"](https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1q3jknt/crosspoint_a_months_retrospective_from_the/)**, posted by daveallie, reflecting on one month of community-driven firmware development.

CrossPoint started as a side project in mid-December 2025 and has evolved into a **fully functional open-source firmware replacement** that handles EPUB reading without XTC conversion workflows. The journey:

**Version history (Dec 13 – Jan 4):**
- **v0.10.0** (Dec 29): First stable release with 134 upvotes, described as "the best reading experience I've had on this device"
- **v0.11.0**: Added four font size options (addressing early feedback)
- **v0.12.0** (Jan 3): Latest update with bug fixes

**What CrossPoint now offers:**
- Native EPUB reading with chapter navigation
- Bold and italic text rendering with anti-aliasing
- Fast file loading (significantly faster than stock firmware)
- Battery percentage display while reading
- Clean boot and sleep screens (with customizable wallpapers)
- Faster input response than official firmware (inputs queue even during screen refresh)

**What's still pending:**
- Image rendering in EPUBs (major gap)
- Advanced text hyphenation
- Font size granularity (currently four fixed sizes)
- Custom theme support

**Real-world adoption data:**
Multiple users this week reported switching from stock firmware:

> "I came over to the dark side today -Crosspoint" (Jan 3 post, positive reception)

> "The wireless transfer is a bit finicky, particularly with my Android phone. It often drops connections, but it's still far better than stock."

> "This firmware already surpasses my expectations for what the device can achieve given its hardware limits."

**Developer transparency:**
daveallie's retrospective emphasized:
- CrossPoint is **not affiliated with Xteink** — it's an independent community project
- Using it carries risk (like any custom firmware)
- The project welcomes contributors
- Installation uses a **browser-based flash utility** (via https://xteink.dve.al), making it more accessible than traditional embedded firmware flashing
- Full backups are recommended before flashing

**Community engagement shift:**
This marks a turning point: **the community is no longer just requesting open-source or better software — it's actively building it**. The question now is whether Xteink acknowledges this momentum or whether CrossPoint becomes the de facto standard for power users.

The fact that a **YouTube guide** (pixelleaves, Jan 1) now includes a full tutorial on flashing CrossPoint signals that it's entered mainstream awareness within the Xteink ecosystem.

## 📅 X3 Remains the Next Big Milestone

While no new X3 announcements arrived this week, existing threads continue to be discovered by new users.

**["X3 Is Coming: Smaller, Lighter, and a Lot More Fun"](https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1pi6ezd/x3_is_coming_smaller_lighter_and_a_lot_more_fun/)** and **["Xteink X3 Live Now"](https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1pjw3ay/xteink_x3_live_now/)** posts continue to answer questions about specs and shipping.

Key reference points for anyone considering pre-orders:

- **Screen**: 3.7 inches, 250+ PPI (sharper than X4's 220 PPI)
- **Weight**: 55g (vs X4's 65g)
- **Charging**: Magnetic pogo pins instead of USB-C
- **Unique feature**: Built-in gyroscope for page-turn by tilting
- **Pricing**: Starting at $72.99
- **Shipping date**: February 5, 2026

Comments still include questions about international shipping costs and the timeline for the **overseas app**. Community members remind newcomers that the official app (currently China-only) is being localized, with a timeline still to be announced.

## 🔗 External Reviews Keep Driving Discovery

During this quieter week, users continuously point newcomers to earlier media coverage rather than new articles appearing.

The **[SquaredTech review](https://www.squaredtech.co/xteink-x4-magnetic-e-reader-review)** from December 7 remains the go-to detailed source for comparisons with Kindle and Kobo models. It breaks down screen resolution, performance trade-offs, and ideal use cases.

Comparison tools like **["Xteink X3 vs X4"](https://comparisontabl.es/e-readers/xteink-x3-vs-xteink-x4/)** continue to clarify spec differences for undecided buyers, showing that Xteink's **December media footprint** is still actively funneling new readers into the ecosystem.

## 📦 Shipping Context and Policy Backdrop

While no major shipping complaint threads emerged this specific week, discussions remain anchored to the official **[Xteink X4 product page](https://www.xteink.com/products/xteink-x4)** and **[shipping policy](https://www.xteink.com/pages/shipping-policy)**.

The shipping policy emphasizes that estimated timelines are subject to:

- Holiday delays (especially Lunar New Year in late January–early February)
- Customs processing variations by country
- Stock availability fluctuations

This context manages expectations as the community looks ahead to the **X3 launch on February 5** and continues to await **stock updates and restock confirmations** for the X4.

## 💭 Overarching Community Themes (Shifted)

The past week has revealed a **major shift in community energy**:

- **Hardware design is solved** – the X4 form factor, MagSafe, weight, and materials are consistently praised
- **Software gap is narrowing** – not through Xteink, but through **CrossPoint**. EPUB handling and text rendering issues now have a working alternative
- **Next-gen features are clear** – frontlight/backlight tops the wishlist, followed by improved app ecosystem and open-source accessibility
- **X3 excitement is building** – February 5 shipping date is circled on many calendars
- **Community projects are now mainstream** – CrossPoint's presence in YouTube tutorials and daily Reddit discussions means it's no longer a niche experiment

The big open question: Will Xteink respond to CrossPoint's success, or will the community's de facto standard firmware eventually diverge from the official path?

## 🔮 What to Watch Next Week

- **X3 shipping begins** – February 5 is just one month away; expect preparation and logistics discussions
- **CrossPoint v1.0.0 release** – daveallie mentioned rapid progress; a stable release could accelerate adoption
- **Xteink official response** – no statement on CrossPoint yet; any acknowledgment would be significant
- **More real-world reviews** – as new devices arrive post-holiday, expect detailed user comparisons (stock vs CrossPoint)

## 🛠️ ReadMe.club Continues as Central Hub

**[ReadMe.club](https://www.readme.club)** remains the unofficial command center for:

- Setup guides and optimization tips
- EPUB conversion workflows and tools
- Wallpaper galleries and customization
- Firmware utilities and language packs
- Community resources and discussion aggregation
- **Soon including:** CrossPoint flashing guides and comparisons with stock firmware

New users discovering Xteink through reviews or podcasts typically land here to find practical guides—and now, firmware alternatives—before their first device arrives.
